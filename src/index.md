Below are most of the contractions in Grade 2 Braile. Selecting a contracdtion will bring you to a page where you can see examples of the contraction in context. The contraction will be contracted in the example but the text surrounding it will be in grade 1 braille. This is not a complete reference nor is it a course in <abbr title="Universal English Braille">UEB</abbr>. It is meant to be a quick reference and nothing more. If you find an error please [let me know](mailto:rbrittbusler92@gmail.com).
