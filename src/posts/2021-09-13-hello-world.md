Hello and welcome to Capital Region Games. Hopefully this place will provide you with information on where to go to play various types of games.

If you have places to add, information on existing places on here and/or site suggestions; you are welcome to do so in several ways:

email: rbrittbus@gmail.com
Github: [Github Issues](https://github.com/CapReg/capitalregiongames/issues). This is more for corrections or if there is an update you would like made

### Contributing

Currently there is no online CMS so adding places will require knowledge of Github and MarkDown. I hope to resolve this in the next several months.

This site was born out of a desire to know where one could play Chess. The site I discovered July of this year (ENYCA) was taken down and [518Games](http://518games.com/) had not been updated since 2008. [518Games](http://518games.com/) though was so well curated and organized. I hope this site is half as organized as that one.

Ultimately, my goal is to get this place to a point where others may easily contribute to it and to a state where if I was to be bored with it I could hand the reigns to someone else who has an attention focus that's longer than 4 seconds. The major front facing part of this site is done so now I will go and try to see how to tackle this much more difficult part.

### The Next Step 

(this is pretty rambly-as is the whole page I suppose.)

Over the next coming weeks, this site will probably see less dramatic changes. I hope to add some blog posts about time controlled tournament styled games vs non time controlled (this requires me to learn a bit about games I know not much about) and to also add more game places. More important than those goals though is to make sure this site is accessible. I am thinking about adding some kind of a demarcation noting if a game place is accessible by bus or not. I still need to do more work to make sure this follows WebAIM standardards and I've yet to test this on JAWS or Microsoft Narrator.

The site still needs a lot of work but at least it has some content 😊.

Happy Gaming!
